Brief Description of Goal of Code:
Create code that makes a rectangle draw/appear when a button is pressed, with another button adding an image into the rectangle, and the last button being one that deletes the image from the rectangle
 
Known Issues:
Need to make a canvas element, as well as buttons to perform tasks (which I am having the biggest issue on, because, though my buttons' animation work,the tasks aren't performing.)
